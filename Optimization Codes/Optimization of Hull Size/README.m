%% In the folder, we want to formulate an optimization problem to determine the size of the robot hull
% after the optimization, we can have the optimal solution for the decision
% 
% geometric decision  d_H (r_H,l_H), additional decision variable is the
% volume of the ballast material, but normally we want to use the ballast
% material as little as possible
