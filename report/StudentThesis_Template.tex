\begin{abstract}
Conventionally, designing an underwater robot requires experienced experts
to adapt the robot structure to a series of designing requirements: buoyancy neutral, high surge velocity, low power consumption, low construction cost and small compact volume, etc. This is usually an iterative process, since most of the robot geometric variables are tightly coupled and immediately affect the vehicle dynamics and performance of the robot. Furthermore, due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of the robot dynamics, changes in the vehicle geometric variables strongly influence the control design. In this work, we propose a novel a system-engineering approach to the controller-geometry-codesign: kinematic and dynamic requirements are derived from a set of desired trajectories the robot should perform. Together with the conventional design requirements we formulate the robot designing procedure as multi-stage iterative optimizations.

Due to the customizable robot geometric structure, we build the robot in a modular way in this work. That is, the robot constituent parts are modeled as simple shapes parametrized by several geometric decision variables. The inertia matrices, Coriolis matrices, restoring matrix and the damping matrix can be calculated from them. As a result, a parametrized vehicle dynamic model indicating the intrinsic couplings among these decision variables is derived.

Trim trajectories are chosen in this thesis since along them the vehicle moves stably. It implies  that all velocities, roll and pitch angles as well as the hydrodynamic coefficients are constant. Based on these characteristics, we can linearize the dynamics of the error between the real robot' states and desired trim states uniquely. Each specified trim trajectory corresponds to a linear multi-input multi-output error dynamic system for a given robot geometry. Thus, the nonlinear robot dynamics is formulated as a linear switched system in the thesis and we utilize switched linear quadratic regulator to control the robot's moving trajectories.

Simulations for optimizing the actuator placements including six thrusters and four fins combined with two thrusters are performed, respectively. According to the simulation results, the proposed optimization algorithm is able to find a locally optimal and controllable robot geometry which can track the desired trim trajectories stably with a unconstrained switched LQR controller.
