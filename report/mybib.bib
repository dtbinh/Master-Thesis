	abstract = "In this work we present Snookie, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with an artificial lateral-line system (ALL). Integration of the ALL with other sensory modalities is to enable the robot to perform behaviours as observed in fish, such as obstacle detection and geometrical-shape reconstruction by means of hydrodynamic images. The present chapter consists of three sections devoted to design of the robot, its lateral-line system, and processing of the ensuing flow-sensory data. The ALL of Snookie is presented in detail, together with a simple version of a flow reconstruction algorithm applicable to both the ALL and, e.g. the blind Mexican cave fish. More in particular, the first section deals with the development of the AUV Snookie, which provides the functionality and is tailored to the requirements of the ALL. The second section is devoted to the implementation of the ALL that consists of an array of hot thermistor anemometers to be integrated in the nozzle. In the final section, the information processing ensuing from the flow sensors and leading to conclusions about the environment is presented. The measurement of the tangential velocities at the ALL together with the no-penetration condition provides the robot with Cauchy boundary conditions, so that the hydrodynamic mapping of potential flow onto the lateral line can be inverted. Through this inversion information is accessible from the flow around the artificial lateral line about objects in the neighbourhood, which alter the flow field."

The objective of this paper is to out- line some of these problems, to review progress made in solving them in a number of diverse communities, and to review some problems that remain open. An important contribution of our work is to bring together material from several areas of research and to present results in a unified manner. We begin our review by relating the stability problem for switched linear systems and a class of linear differential inclusions. Closely related to the concept of stability are the notions of exponential growth rates and converse Lyapunov theorems, both of which are discussed in detail. In particular, results on common quadratic Lyapunov func- tions and piecewise linear Lyapunov functions are presented, as they represent constructive methods for proving stability and also represent problems in which significant progress has been made. We also comment on the inherent difficulty in determining stability of switched systems in general, which is exemplified by NP-hardness and undecidability results. We then proceed by considering the stability of switched systems in which there are constraints on the switching rules, through both dwell-time requirements and state-dependent switch- ing laws. Also in this case the theory of Lyapunov functions and the existence of converse theorems are reviewed. We briefly comment on the classical Lur'e problem and on the theory of stability radii, both of which contain many of the features of switched systems and are rich sources of practical results on the topic. Finally we present a list of questions and open problems which provide motivation for continued research in this area.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57{\%}, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

abstract = {An aerial robot is a system capable of sustained flight with no direct human control and able to perform a specific task. A lighter than air robot is an aerial robot that relies on the static lift to balance its own weight. It can also be defined as a lighter than air unmanned aerial vehicle or an unmanned airship with sufficient autonomy. Lighter than air systems are particularly appealing since the energy to keep them airborne is small. They are increasingly considered for various tasks such as monitoring, surveillance, advertising, freight carrier, transportation.This book familiarizes readers with a hierarchical decoupled planning and control strategy that has been proven efficient through research. It is made up of a hierarchy of modules with well defined functions operating at a variety of rates, linked together from top to bottom. The outer loop, closed periodically, consists of a discrete search that produces a set of waypoints leading to the goal while avoiding obstacles and weighed regions. The second level smoothes this set so that the generated paths are feasible given the vehicle's velocity and accelerations limits. The third level generates flyable, timed trajectories and the last one is the tracking controller that attempts to minimize the error between the robot measured trajectory and the reference trajectory. This hierarchy is reflected in the structure and content of the book. Topics treated are: Modelling, Flight Planning, Trajectory Design and Control. Finally, some actual projects are described in the appendix. This volume will prove useful for researchers and practitioners working in Robotics and Automation, Aerospace Technology, Control and Artificial Intelligence.},

abstract = {Multi-robot systems are a major research topic in robotics. Designing, testing and deploying in the real world a large number of aerial robots is a concrete possibility due to the recent technological advances. The first section of this chapter treats the different aspects of cooperation in a multi-agent systems. A cooperative control should be designed in terms of the available feedback information. A cascade-type guidance law is proposed, followed by consensus approach and flocking behavior. Since information flow over the network changes over time, cooperative control must react accordingly but ensure group cooperative behavior which is the major issue in analysis and synthesis. Connectivity and convergence of formations are also studied. Team approach is followed by deterministic decision making. Plans may be required for a team of aerial robots to plan for sensing, plan for action or plan for communication. Distributed receding horizon control as well as conflict resolution, artificial potentials and symbolic planning are thus analyzed. Then, association with limited communications is studied, followed by genetic algorithms and game theory reasoning. Next, multi-agent decision making under uncertainty is considered, formulating the Bayesian decentralized team decision problem, with and without explicit communication. Algorithms for optimal planning are then introduced as well as for task allocation and distributed chance constrained task allocation. Finally, some case studies are presented such as reconnaissance mission that can be defined as the road search problem or the general vehicle routing problem. Then, an approach is considered to coordinate a group of aerial robots without a central supervision, by using only local interactions between the robots. The third case is the optimization of perimeter patrol operation. If an aerial robot must be close from a location to monitor it correctly and the number of aerial robots does not allow covering each site simultaneously, a path planning problem arises. Finally stochastic strategies for surveillance are presented. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract = {We analyze the observability properties of the kinematic model of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) moving in 3D, under the influence of ocean currents, using range and depth measurements. The results obtained shed light into the types of trajectories that an AUV may be requested to undergo in order to ensure observability, which is a crucial step in the design of single or multiple beacon positioning systems. We assume that the AUV is equipped with two sensor suites: the first computes the distance (range) of the AUV to single or multiple fixed transponders, while the second measures the vehicle's depth. In both situations, the vehicle has access to its heading angle. We further assume that the AUV undergoes maneuvers commonly known as trimming trajectories, that are naturally obtained when the inputs (thruster rpms and control surface deflections) are held constant. This is done for two main reasons: (i) the class of trajectories thus generated is sufficiently rich for a vast number of applications and (ii) from an observability-analysis standpoint they lead to mathematical tractability and allow for an intuitive physical interpretation. These facts stand in sharp contrast to common approaches adopted in the literature, where the characterization of trajectories that yield observability is only implicit and defies a simple interpretation. In the set-up adopted, the trimming trajectories are completely characterized by three variables: (a) linear body speed ∥v∥; (b) flight-path angle $\gamma$; and (c) yaw rate $\psi$. We assume that ∥v∥ {\textgreater} 0, $\gamma$, and $\psi$ are constant but otherwise arbitrary (within the constraints of the vehicle capabilities) and examine the observability of the resulting system with the two above mentioned sensor suites. We adopt definitions of observability and weak observability that seek inspiration from those proposed by Herman and Krener (1977) but reflect the fact that we consider specific kinds of maneuvers in 3D. We start with the single transponder case. For range measurements only, we show that in the absence of ocean currents the 3D kinematic model of an AUV undergoing trimming trajectories with nonzero flight-path angle and yaw rate is observable. In the case of non-zero but known ocean currents, identical results apply subject to the condition that the flight-path angle satisfies a current-related constraint. However, if the current is non-zero and unknown, the model is only weakly observable. The situation changes completely when both range and depth measurements are available. In this case, under the assumption that the yaw rate is different from zero, observability is obtained even when the flight-path angle is zero (vehicle moving in a horizontal plane) and there are non-zero unknown currents. These obvious advantages are lost if yaw rate is equal to zero, for in this case the model is only weakly observable. In all situations where the model is weakly observable we give a complete characterization of the sets of states that are indistinguishable from a given initial state. Finally, we show that the extended model that is obtained by considering multiple (at least two) transponders is observable in all situations if the yaw rate is different from zero.},

abstract="During the 1990s, numerous worldwide research and development activities have occurred in underwater robotics, especially in the area of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). As the ocean attracts great attention on environmental issues and resources as well as scientific and military tasks, the need for and use of underwater robotic systems has become more apparent. Great efforts have been made in developing AUVs to overcome challenging scientific and engineering problems caused by the unstructured and hazardous ocean environment. In the 1990s, about 30 new AUVs have been built worldwide. With the development of new materials, advanced computing and sensory technology, as well as theoretical advancements, R{\&}D activities in the AUV community have increased. However, this is just the beginning for more advanced, yet practical and reliable AUVs. This paper surveys some key areas in current state-of-the-art underwater robotic technologies. It is by no means a complete survey but provides key references for future development. The new millennium will bring advancements in technology that will enable the development of more practical, reliable AUVs.",

abstract = { This paper aims to democratize the design and fabrication of robots, enabling people of all skill levels to make robots without needing expert domain knowledge. Existing work in computational design and rapid fabrication has explored this question of customization for physical objects but so far has not been able to conquer the complexity of robot designs. We have developed Interactive Robogami, a tool for composition-based design of ground robots that can be fabricated as flat sheets and then folded into 3D structures. This rapid prototyping process enables users to create lightweight, affordable, and materially versatile robots with short turnaround time. Using Interactive Robogami, designers can compose new robot designs from a database of print-and-fold parts. The designs are tested for the users’ functional specifications via simulation and fabricated on user satisfaction. We present six robots designed and fabricated using a 3D printing based approach, as well as a larger robot cut from sheet metal. We have also conducted a user study that demonstrates that our tool is intuitive for novice designers and expressive enough to create a wide variety of ground robot designs. }

abstract = {Multivariable Feedback Control: Analysis and Design, Second Edition presents a rigorous, yet easily readable, introduction to the analysis and design of robust multivariable control systems. Focusing on practical feedback control and not on system theory in general, this book provides the reader with insights into the opportunities and limitations of feedback control. Taking into account the latest developments in the field, this fully revised and updated second edition: * features a new chapter devoted to the use of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs); * presents current results on fundamental performance limitations introduced by RHP-poles and RHP-zeros; * introduces updated material on the selection of controlled variables and self-optimizing control; * provides simple IMC tuning rules for PID control; * covers additional material including unstable plants, the feedback amplifier, the lower gain margin and a clear strategy for incorporating integral action into LQG control; * includes numerous worked examples, exercises and case studies, which make frequent use of Matlab and the new Robust Control toolbox. Multivariable Feedback Control: Analysis and Design, Second Edition is an excellent resource for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses studying multivariable control. It is also an invaluable tool for engineers who want to understand multivariable control, its limitations, and how it can be applied in practice. The analysis techniques and the material on control structure design should prove very useful in the new emerging area of systems biology. Reviews of the first edition: "Being rich in insights and practical tips on controller design, the book should also prove to be very beneficial to industrial control engineers, both as a reference book and as an educational tool." Applied Mechanics Reviews "In summary, this book can be strongly recommended not only as a basic text in multivariable control techniques for graduate and undergraduate students, but also as a valuable source of information for control engineers."

abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has a long history in the field of control en- gineering. It is one of the few areas that has received on-going interest from researchers in both the industrial and academic communities. Four major as- pects of model predictive control make the design methodology attractive to both practitioners and academics. The first aspect is the design formulation, which uses a completely multivariable system framework where the perfor- mance parameters of the multivariable control system are related to the engi- neering aspects of the system; hence, they can be understood and ‘tuned' by engineers. The second aspect is the ability of the method to handle both ‘soft' constraints and hard constraints in a multivariable control framework. This is particularly attractive to industry where tight profit margins and limits on the process operation are inevitably present. The third aspect is the ability to perform on-line process optimization. The fourth aspect is the simplicity of the design framework in handling all these complex issues. This book gives an introduction to model predictive control, and recent developments in design and implementation. Beginning with an overview of the field, the book will systematically cover topics in receding horizon con- trol, MPC design formulations, constrained control, Laguerre-function-based predictive control, predictive control using exponential data weighting, refor- mulation of classical predictive control, tuning of predictive control, as well as simulation and implementation using MATLAB? and SIMULINK? as a platform. Both continuous-time and discrete-time model predictive control is presented in a similar framework.},

abstract = {Deals with the configuration of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for inspection of underwater cables considering low hydrodynamic drag, sensor alignment, collision avoidance manoeuvre, turning manoeuvre and rolling motion. The AUV consists of a fuselage of body of revolution with low hydrodynamic drag, fore and aft horizontal wings, upper and lower vertical tails and a pair of horizontal thrusters at both sides of the aft horizontal wings. The shape of the forward horizontal wing and that of the rear horizontal wing can be determined by use of a nonlinear optimization method under the constraints of magnetic sensor alignment for cable tracking, dynamic stability in the vertical plane and the performance of the collision avoidance manoeuvre. The performance of the turning manoeuvre and rolling motion are attributed to thrust force difference between a pair of thrusters at both sides of the rear horizontal wing, because the shapes of the upper and lower vertical tails can be designed from the viewpoint of the dynamic stability in horizontal plane},

abstract = { We derived a control allocation algorithm for low-speed marine craft using propellers and rudders. Active use of rudders has advantages in a low-speed operation by decreasing the need for propeller power and fuel. However, at low speed, a rudder is effective only for positive thrust. This complicates the thrust allocation problem which can no longer be solved by convex quadratic programming. In fact, the existence of local minima introduces discontinuities in the commanded thruster signals even if the desired control force is continuous. Discontinuous signals cause excessive wear on the thruster system and must be avoided. This paper suggests an analytic, 2-norm optimal method that can ensure continuity of the solutions. Being analytic, however, its limitation is the capability of handling only configurations where one single thrust device is subject to sector constraints at a time. Experiments with a model ship illustrate the potential for fuel saving. For this particular vessel, the energy consumption was halved. An output feedback tracking control law with integral action was simultaneously derived and analyzed. Semiglobal ship controllers like this one rely on the yaw rate being bounded, and an admittedly conservative method for determining this upper bound was proposed.},

@article{Moore1981,
abstract = {Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX{\_}{\{}c{\}}, X{\_}{\{}bar{\{}o{\}}{\}}, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the development of an algorithm for unstable continuous/discrete-time system decomposition into completely stable and completely unstable subsystems using real Schur transformation technique. The application of the proposed algorithm is investigated for unstable LTI plant or controller reduction and the available balanced realized model reduction theories applicable for stable systems are extended for unstable, continuous/discrete-time systems. The algorithm and its applications are illustrated with MATLAB-based computer-simulated results for continuous and discrete-time systems. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Franklin Institute.

@article{Zhou1999,
abstract = {This paper proposes a new balanced realization and model reduction method for possibly unstable systems by introducing some new controllability and observability Gramians. These Gramians can be related to minimum control energy and minimum estimation error. In contrast to Gramians defined in the literature for unstable systems, these Gramians can always be computed for systems without imaginary axis poles and they reduce to the standard controllability and observability Gramians when the systems are stable. The proposed balanced model reduction method enjoys the similar error bounds as does for the standard balanced model reduction. Furthermore, the new error bounds and the actual approximation errors seem to be much smaller than the ones using the methods given in the literature for unstable systems.

@article{Zhang2016,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the issues of feasibility, stability and robustness on the switched model predictive control (MPC) of a class of discrete-time switched linear systems with mode-dependent dwell time (MDT). The concept of conventional MDT in the literature of switched systems is extended to the stage MDT of lengths that vary with the stages of the switching. By computing the steps over which all the reachable sets of a starting region are contained into a targeting region, the minimum admissible MDT is offline determined so as to guarantee the persistent feasibility of MPC design. Then, conditions stronger than the criteria for persistent feasibility are explored to ensure the asymptotic stability. A concept of the extended controllable set is further proposed, by which the complete feasible region for given constant MDT can be determined such that the switched MPC law can be persistently solved and the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. The techniques developed for nominal systems lay a foundation for the same issues on systems with bounded additive disturbance, and the switched tube-based MPC methodology is established. A required "switched" tube in the form of mode-dependent cross section is determined by computing a mode-dependent generalized robust positive invariant set for each error subsystem between nominal subsystem and disturbed subsystem. The theoretical results are testified via an illustrative example of a population ecological system.},
